# TODO Items

- [ ] Try it out on various small/large C/C++ open source projects
- [x] Allow user to specify a single component and the tool should print only that component
- [x] Print out dependency graphs for all components by default if no single component is specified
- [ ] Use a compiler to get the includes for a file rather than manually scanning the contents
- [ ] Parallelise dependency scanning as much as possible to get the best possible performance
- [ ] Open up the graph automatically after generating an individual graph?
- [ ] Work with any sort of project structure
  - [x] source and header files for component in same directory
  - [ ] source files in same directory but header files in a separate `inc` directory
  - [x] source files in same directory but header files in a global `inc` directory (all project header files in one place)
  - [ ] source files and header files don't have matching names (i.e. there's an `api.h` header file and various source files implement them)
- [ ] Highlight strongly coupled components (i.e. have lots of outgoing/incoming dependencies). How to visualise strongly coupled components?
- [ ] Provide coupling/cohesion metrics, lookup metrics from Clean Architecture and [this](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/151004/are-there-metrics-for-cohesion-and-coupling)
- [ ] Work with any type of include relative includes ('blah.h') vs absolute includes ('/path/blah.h') vs relative with path includes ('blah/blah.h')
- [ ] <system> include vs "project" include (how will this work for third party sources that are not part of the codebase?)
- [ ] 3D visualisation using something like https://github.com/ggeoffrey/cljs-gravity
- [ ] Node size - base it on how many source files (or lines of code)
- [ ] Ignore list? Some components may not want to be seen
- [ ] Use a yaml config file? A pain to pass a whole heap of arguments every time
- [ ] Make the tool incremental? Only generate parts of the new graph if something has changed. Something to think about
- [ ] Look at using subgraphs of the dot/svg language to cluster component dependencies in the graph
- [ ] Provide a 'zoom' slider on the visualisation to zoom in/out of the view (high level dependencies to low-level dependencies)
- [ ] Handling `duplicate` component names? Use a unique identifier (perhaps the path?)
