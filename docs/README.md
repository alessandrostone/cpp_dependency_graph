title: "Github Pages for Non-Developers: Build Web Portfolios From Scratch"
---

<section class="sec">
This is a very narrowly focused tutorial about web development aimed at novices who have absolutely no web dev experience, nor have used [Github](https://github.com) or [Git](http://git-scm.com/), or even the command line.

The end product is a web portfolio, built (mostly) from scratch, that is easy to edit and easy to publish _anywhere_ &ndash; Github merely provides an easy starting point.
