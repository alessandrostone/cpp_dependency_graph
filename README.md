[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shreyasbharath/cpp_dependency_graph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shreyasbharath/cpp_dependency_graph)

Generates useful dependency graphs to study the architecture of a C/C++ codebase.

Why do all the other languages have awesome tools to analyse codebases but C/C++ codebases do not?

It's time to change that.

This tool aims to
